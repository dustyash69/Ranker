# How do I use Ranker?

## If you're using Ranker for the first time:
1) In the `How long should the app wait for loading?` input field, enter a whole number. This number is the amount of seconds that the app waits for the page to load. This number depends on how fast your PC and Internet is. **3** usually does the trick.
2) Now, go to your File Manager and create a new folder where Ranker will store files. Click on the `Choose Location` button and select the Folder you just created.
3) Click on the `Download data` button. This will open a new tab in Microsoft Edge. Please do **NOT** interact with this window in any way. Let it do its job, undisturbed. This may take a while.

Then, Click on the `Choose Location` button and select the Folder you used before.
